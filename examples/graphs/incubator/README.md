# Incubator Graph Definitions

These YAML files use an **experimental DSL** (`type: entry/action/branch` with `${state...}` expressions) that is **not yet executed** by the HUAP engine.

They are kept here for future reference and development.

**The runnable YAML spec** uses `nodes[]` + `edges[]` with `run:` import paths.
See `examples/graphs/hello.yaml` and `examples/graphs/hello_workflow.yaml` for working examples.
