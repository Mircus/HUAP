**Trace-first Agent CI + Specialist Squad Orchestrator.**

> "Keep your framework. HUAP makes it reproducible, diffable, and CI-gated."

HUAP Core provides the foundational toolkit for building AI agent systems that are:

- 🧾 **Traceable** — every action recorded as replayable JSONL events
- 🔁 **Deterministic** — stub mode + replay verification for reproducible testing
- 🧪 **Evaluatable** — cost/quality grading to gate regressions in CI
- 🤖 **Squad-ready** — specialist model router picks the right model for each task
- 🔌 **Framework-agnostic** — adapters for CrewAI, LangChain, or wrap any script
- 🚦 **Human-gated** — pause, review, and approve agent actions via an inbox
- 🧩 **Pluggable** — plugin SDK for memory backends, tool packs, and providers

---

## 🚀 3-Minute Wow Path

Six commands, copy-paste from repo root. No API keys needed.

```bash
# 1. Install
pip install huap-core

# 2. Flagship demo — research → analyze → human gate → synthesize → memorize
huap flagship --no-open
# outputs: huap_flagship_demo/trace.jsonl, trace.html, memo.md

# 3. One-liner demo — runs a graph, generates an HTML report, opens it in your browser
huap demo

# 4. Diff two stub runs — proves deterministic replay catches drift
HUAP_LLM_MODE=stub huap trace run hello examples/graphs/hello.yaml --out /tmp/a.jsonl
HUAP_LLM_MODE=stub huap trace run hello examples/graphs/hello.yaml --out /tmp/b.jsonl
huap trace diff /tmp/a.jsonl /tmp/b.jsonl

# 5. CI gate with baseline — runs suite, diffs vs golden, produces HTML report
huap ci run suites/smoke/suite.yaml --html reports/smoke.html

# 6. Shareable HTML artifact — standalone report you can send to anyone
huap trace report /tmp/a.jsonl --out reports/trace.html
```

| Command | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `huap flagship` | Full 5-node pipeline: research, analysis, human gate, synthesis, memory |
| `huap demo` | Full graph → trace → HTML report pipeline works out of the box |
| `huap trace diff` | Two identical stub runs produce zero drift |
| `huap ci run` | Suite runner diffs against golden baselines and gates CI |
| `huap trace report` | Any trace becomes a self-contained, shareable HTML artifact |

---

## 🧭 Golden Path (5 Minutes)

### 1) Initialize a workspace
```bash
huap init myproject && cd myproject
```
Creates: `pods/`, `graphs/`, `traces/`, `suites/`, `budgets/`, `.env.example`, and a runnable hello workflow.

### 2) Run with tracing (stub mode)
```bash
export HUAP_LLM_MODE=stub
huap trace run hello graphs/hello.yaml --out traces/hello.jsonl
```

### 3) View the trace
```bash
huap trace view traces/hello.jsonl
```

### 4) Replay & verify (deterministic)
```bash
huap trace replay traces/hello.jsonl --mode exec --verify
```

### 5) Diff two runs (detect drift)
```bash
huap trace run hello graphs/hello.yaml --out traces/hello_v2.jsonl
huap trace diff traces/hello.jsonl traces/hello_v2.jsonl
```

### 6) Generate an HTML report
```bash
huap trace report traces/hello.jsonl --out reports/hello.html
```

### 7) Wrap any existing script
```bash
huap trace wrap --out traces/wrapped.jsonl -- python my_agent.py
```

## 🧩 Key Concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pod** | A self-contained agent: tools + workflows |
| **Trace** | JSONL event stream of the full run |
| **Replay** | Re-run deterministically using recorded events (or stubs) |
| **Diff** | Compare two traces for behavioral/cost regressions |
| **Eval** | Grade a trace against budgets/constraints |

### Workflow YAML Spec

HUAP currently executes the **`nodes[]` + `edges[]`** YAML spec.
Each node has a `run:` field pointing to an importable Python function:

```yaml
nodes:
  - name: start
    run: my_pod.nodes.start_node
  - name: greet
    run: my_pod.nodes.greet_node

edges:
  - from: start
    to: greet
  - from: greet
    to: null
```

> An experimental DSL (`type: entry/action/branch` with `${state...}`) lives in
> `examples/graphs/incubator/` — it is **not executed** by the current engine.

## 🤖 Specialist Squad (Model Router)

HUAP's model router assigns the right model to each task — local-first, cost-aware, and fully deterministic.

```bash
huap models init
huap models list
huap models explain --capability chat --privacy local
```

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Model Registry** | Declare models with capabilities, privacy, and cost (`config/models.yaml`) |
| **Rule-based Router** | Ordered policy rules; first match wins (`config/router.yaml`) |
| **Providers** | Stub (no deps), Ollama (stdlib), OpenAI (optional) |
| **Explain** | Full transparency on every routing decision |
| **Trace Integration** | Router decisions emitted as `policy_check` trace events |

Enable with: `HUAP_ROUTER_ENABLED=1`

---

## 🔌 Framework Adapters

Keep your existing framework — HUAP makes it traceable.

**CrewAI (manual instrumentation):**
```python
from hu_core.adapters.crewai import huap_trace_crewai

with huap_trace_crewai(out="traces/crewai.jsonl", run_name="demo") as tracer:
    tracer.on_agent_step("researcher", "Find info about AI")
    tracer.on_llm_request("gpt-4o", [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}])
    tracer.on_llm_response("gpt-4o", "...", usage={"total_tokens": 50})
    crew.kickoff()
```
> CrewAI has no public callback API, so events must be added manually.
> The trace is still fully compatible with replay, diff, eval, and CI.

**LangChain / LangGraph:**
```python
from hu_core.adapters.langchain import HuapCallbackHandler

handler = HuapCallbackHandler(out="traces/langchain.jsonl")
chain.invoke({"input": "hello"}, config={"callbacks": [handler]})
handler.flush()
```

**Any script:**
```bash
huap trace wrap --out traces/agent.jsonl -- python my_agent.py
```

All adapters produce standard HUAP traces compatible with replay, diff, eval, and CI.

## 🧰 Safe Batteries

Two safe-by-default tools for agent workflows:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `http_fetch_safe` | HTTP GET with domain allowlist, timeout, size cap, content-type filter |
| `fs_sandbox` | File I/O confined to a root directory — no path traversal |

---

## 🚦 Human Gates & Inbox

Agents can pause at designated **human gates** — checkpoints that require human review before the workflow continues. Pending gates land in an inbox where a human can approve, reject, or edit parameters.

**Flow:** node raises gate → request written to `.huap/inbox/` → human decides via CLI → workflow resumes with the decision.

```bash
huap inbox list                             # See pending gates
huap inbox show <gate_id>                   # View gate details + context
huap inbox approve <gate_id> --note "LGTM"  # Approve and resume
huap inbox reject  <gate_id> --note "Too expensive"
huap inbox edit    <gate_id> --json patch.json  # Edit params and approve
```

Live-tail a trace to watch gates, issues, and budget warnings in real time:

```bash
huap watch traces/run.jsonl
huap watch traces/run.jsonl --only issues,gates
```

---

## 🧩 Plugins & Memory

HUAP's plugin SDK lets you extend the platform without bloating core.

```bash
huap plugins init           # Create config/plugins.yaml
huap plugins list           # Show registered plugins + status
```

### HindsightProvider (SQLite memory backend)

The `HindsightProvider` gives agents persistent memory via SQLite — zero extra dependencies:

```bash
# Store findings during a flagship run
huap flagship --with-memory --no-open

# Search persisted memories
huap memory search "AI agent"

# View database statistics
huap memory stats

# Ingest any trace into memory
huap memory ingest --from-trace traces/hello.jsonl
```

Memory operations emit trace events, so they appear in HTML reports and can be diffed in CI.

### MemoryPort (retain / recall / reflect)

The `MemoryPort` interface lets agents persist and retrieve knowledge across runs:

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `retain(key, value)` | Store a finding for future sessions |
| `recall(query, k)` | Retrieve relevant memories by keyword |
| `reflect(user_id, pod)` | Summarize what the agent has learned |

### Memory Tools

Built-in `memory_tools` (`hu_core.tools.memory_tools`) give nodes access to `retain`, `recall`, and `reflect` operations. An **ingest policy** (`hu_core.policies`) controls what gets stored — with automatic **secret redaction** (API keys, tokens, credentials are stripped before storage).
